## Overview

### The challenge

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to keep developing my understanding of for...of loops and forEach loops. I also want to solidify my understanding of event listeners. I feel like I understand it on a base level, but when going into details and targeting specific elements within the loops, I felt a little bit lost. Rather than having a concrete understanding, I was just doing trial and error. 

I also shoehorned my self into a certain way of getting my code to work. I should have stepped back and seen it from a different perspective. Doing this saved me some time, as I realized I was doing an unncessarily complicated solution, and instead used class lists. 

There's one thing I'm still not completely satisfied with though. The interaction with the hover state and active state on the button is not too smooth. It only removes the hover state after the cursor is moved. Hopefully I can eventually figure out a different way to make this smoother.

### Useful resources

- [Disabling Hover effect in JS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26754497/css-disable-hover-effect) - This helped me figure out how to disable the hover effect on my buttons. 
- [CSS Animation Generator](https://animista.net/play/basic/flip) - This was a great resource for generating CSS Animations.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give kudos to @andrejcode. I was trying to figure out JS solutions using weird logic with background colors and nested if/else statements and was just completely at a roadblock. I wound up taking a peek at people's solutions and saw his. We had pretty similar JS approaches, but he gave me the idea to use classlists.
