### Continued development

For future projects, I want to keep developing my understanding of for...of loops and forEach loops. I also want to solidify my understanding of event listeners. I feel like I understand it on a base level, but when going into details and targeting specific elements within the loops, I felt a little bit lost. Rather than having a concrete understanding, I was just doing trial and error. 

I also shoehorned my self into a certain way of getting my code to work. I should have stepped back and seen it from a different perspective. Doing this saved me some time, as I realized I was doing an unncessarily complicated solution, and instead used class lists. 

### Useful resources

- [Disabling Hover effect in JS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26754497/css-disable-hover-effect) - This helped me figure out how to disable the hover effect on my buttons. 
- [CSS Animation Generator](https://animista.net/play/basic/flip) - This was a great resource for generating CSS Animations.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give kudos to @andrejcode. I was trying to figure out JS solutions using weird logic with background colors and nested if/else statements and was just completely at a roadblock. I wound up taking a peek at people's solutions and saw his. We had pretty similar JS approaches, but he gave me the idea to use classlists.
